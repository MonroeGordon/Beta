# Beta
Beta is an AI chatbot powered by OpenAI's GPT 3.5 and Microsoft Azure cognitive services. An OpenAI API key and Microsoft Azure Speech API key are required and must be located in your system's PATH variables.

Beta can receive spoken or typed prompts and respond accordingly. Speak to Beta with the 'spacebar' key or type your prompt to Beta with the 't' key. Beta's spoken responses can be paused/unpaused with the 'p' key, and its spoken responses can be stopped when pressing the 'spacebar' or 't' key. To end your conversation with Beta at anytime and end the program, you can press the 'x' key.
